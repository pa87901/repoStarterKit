# repoStarterKit

Developer: Preda (Wen) Anuvatnujotikul

Notes:
This is a repository that I created to help others develop their websites in React.
Please follow the instructions on getting started on my Medium page:
https://medium.com/@Preda/getting-started-on-building-a-personal-website-with-react-b44ee93b1710

In my article, the steps to create your own website include:
1. File architecture
2. Setting up the basic environment in Node
3. Installing the React framework
4. Creating a webpack and configuration
5. Building the basic front-end components
6. Styling and CSS
7. Viewing on local host
8. Deploying on Heroku
