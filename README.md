# Start building your own website
This is a repository that I created to help others develop their websites in React.



## Tech stack
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) & [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [Node](https://github.com/nodejs) & [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)



## Getting started

### Setting up the basic environment in Node:
You will need to install Node globally if you do not have it installed already on your local drive:
```
sudo npm install -g
```
Installing Nodemon is also highly recommended as it watches for any changes that are saved and will automatically restart your application with the updated code base.
```
npm install nodemon -g 
```

### Installing dependencies
The prescribed dependencies needed for building a website are listed in the `package.json` file of this repository.
Once this repo is cloned to your local drive, from within the root directory:
```
npm install
```



## Additional information
